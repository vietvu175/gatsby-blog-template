  Developer Diary - A Gatsby Starter
</h1>

![devDiary](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/605o40f9b92e9m8/devdiary.jpg?dl=0)

*Developer Diary is a Gatsby Starter blog template created with web developers in mind, but really, anyone can use it. It's totally usable right out of the box, but minimalist enough to be easily modifiable to suit your needs. No matter how much you change it, though, you'll definitely want to make use of the tech tags and developer social media links, and maybe even make some of your own.*<br>

## Getting Started
If you don't have Gatsby CLI installed yet, do that:
```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
Install this starter with your name of choice for your blog:
```
gatsby new your-blog-name https://github.com/willjw3/gatsby-starter-developer-diary.git
```
Navigate into your new project's directory:
```
cd your-blog-name
```
and run the development server:
```
gatsby develop
```
Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see your new blog.

## Adding Your Information To The Blog
You can add your blog's url, title, tagline, author, social-media contact info and more in the `config.js` file. You'll also find the props for the tech tags in `config.js`. You'll see that all of this information is used as metadata in the `gatsby-config.js` file.
Things to keep in mind when editing `config.js`
- Don't add a trailing slash to your url. For example `https://mysite.com`, not `https://mysite.com/`
- The social media urls you provide for your social-media accounts (GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc,...) will make it so that clicking the corresponding social media icons will take you to your account pages.<br>

To add your profile image to the blog, add your image file to `src/images`, then import the file into both `src/components/sidebar/Bio.js` and `src/components/header/MobileBio.js`

## Adding Blog Posts
Using your favorite text editor, go into your project's directory and find the `content` folder. In that folder, you'll find the `blog` folder. In the `blog` folder, add a new folder with your new blog post's name in mind. For example, if your post were to be called "Make a Blog With Gatsby", you might want to create the folder `content/blog/make-blog-with-gatsby` <br>

In that newly created folder, add a markdown file called `index.md` (All of your posts will have their content in files called `index.md`).<br>

Add the frontmatter to that markdown file:
```
---
title: 'Make a Blog With React'
tags: ["react", "nodejs"]
published: true
date: '2019-05-29'
---
```
and then add the rest of your content below the frontmatter. 
<br>
To add an image to a blog post (at the top, above the content and under the tags), add the image to the `images` folder in the `src` folder. Then add the relative path to the image in the frontmatter along with the desired width and height of the image in pixels.
```
---
title: 'Make a Blog With React'
tags: ["react", "nodejs"]
featuredImage: "../../../src/images/gatsby-icon.png"
imageWidth: 200
imageHeight: 200
published: true
date: '2019-05-29'
---
```

## Making Tech Tags
This starter already includes the tech tags you can see in the live demo. To use them, add the appropriate tag name to the `tags` array in the frontmatter of your post. Consult the `config.js` file to see the tag properties and get the tag name to be supplied to the `tags` array in the frontmatter.<br>
To make a new tag, create a new "label" in `config.js`, find a suitable svg icon, and paste the svg path in as the value for the "name" property of the label. Have a look at the existing labels in the `config.js` file and all should soon be clear. A good place to look for svg icons is at [simple icons](https://simpleicons.org/).
